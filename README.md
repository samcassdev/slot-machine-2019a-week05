# Slot Machine Project

This web application allows users to bet maximum and minimum values to receive random results on their winning sorted house. In this case, the slot machine was used to sort students as seen on Harry Potter through a new and creative lottery system.

## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## Optimizations

I would add a feature to allow the user to input information about themselves to also see how their personalities, strengths, and weaknesses can also come to play in which house they are sorted into.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I was able to further my learning when utilizing Math.random as well as declaring the maximum and minimum total values for each reel.
